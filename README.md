**Adventure Works Analytics**

**Overview**

The Adventure Works Analytics project employs Python, PostgreSQL, and Power BI to conduct a multi-faceted analysis of sales data. The project aims to extract valuable business insights related to sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

**Project Workflow**

1.  **Data Analysis with Python:**
    *   **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Using `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`, the raw sales, product, and customer data are cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis.
    *   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Key metrics are visualized to understand sales patterns, high-performing products, and customer segmentation.

2.  **Database Management with PostgreSQL:**
    *   **Data Storage:** Cleaned data is stored in a PostgreSQL database for efficient querying and analysis.
    *   **Advanced Queries:** SQL is leveraged to extract deeper insights like regional sales performance and customer demographics.

3.  **Visualization with Power BI:**
    *   **Interactive Dashboards:** Power BI is used to create dynamic visualizations, allowing stakeholders to explore the data interactively.

**Key Steps in the Analysis**

**Data Cleaning & Transformation**

The raw data is imported into Python and undergoes essential cleaning and transformation:

*   **Merging Data:** Sales data from 2020 to 2022 is consolidated into a single dataset.
*   **Date Handling:** Date columns are converted to datetime format for time-series analysis.
*   **Product Data Enhancement:** New columns like `SKUType` are created for better product categorization.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Key aspects of sales data are explored using Python:

*   **Sales Trends:** Analyze sales trends over time to identify peak periods.
*   **Product Performance:** Identify top-performing products and categories.
*   **Customer Segmentation:** Group customers based on demographics and buying behavior.

**Database Integration with PostgreSQL**

The cleaned data is stored in a PostgreSQL database:

*   **Table Creation:** Tables are created to store sales, product, and customer data.
*   **SQL Queries:** SQL queries extract and analyze data from the database.

**Visualization with Power BI**

Interactive dashboards are created in Power BI:

*   **Sales Performance Dashboards:** Visualize sales data for dynamic exploration.
*   **Customer Insights:** Dashboards to understand customer behavior better.

**How to Reproduce the Analysis**

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Python 3.x:** with `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
*   **PostgreSQL:** For database management
*   **Power BI:** For visualization

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Anandhuvimalan/AdventureWorks-Analytics-with-Python-PostgreSQL-and-Power-BI.git
    ```

2.  **Install Python Packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
    ```

3.  **Run Jupyter Notebook:**
    *   Execute `AdventureWorks.ipynb` for data analysis and transformation.

4.  **Load Data into PostgreSQL:**
    *   Use SQL scripts to create tables and load data.
    *   Execute queries to replicate the analysis.

5.  **Visualize with Power BI:**
    *   Open the Power BI dashboard and connect to your PostgreSQL database.

**Results and Insights**

The analysis uncovered key findings:

*   **Seasonal Sales Trends:** Identify periods with significant sales spikes.
*   **Product Success:** Pinpoint products driving the most revenue.
*   **Customer Demographics:** Segment customers contributing to sales growth.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the power of integrating Python, PostgreSQL, and Power BI for comprehensive data analysis. It underscores the value of combining programming, databases, and visualization to extract actionable business insights.
